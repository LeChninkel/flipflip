### Making changes

Create a new branch, make your changes, and open a pull request. The
policy of the FlipFlip project is, "patches are generally accepted."
If your contributions make sense, you will be added as a collaborator
on the project to make changes as you wish. :-)

### JS style guide

* Use proper TypeScript. Some hacks are OK, but be reasonable.
* `import`, not `require`. (To make non-TypeScript modules work, add an entry
  to `src/declaration.d.ts`.)
* 2-space tabs.

### CSS style guide

* The top level of every React component simply has the component's full name as its CSS class
  (`<div className="Modal">`)
* Markup inside the component is `ClassName__Whatever` (`Modal__CloseButton`)
* For different states of the same component, make `m-blah` classes. (`Checkbox m-disabled`)
* For classes used on different kinds of elements, use `u-blah`, like `u-fill-screen`

### Contribution guidelines

* Try to keep the code repository and the application itself G-rated.
  If you want to break this guideline, email ififfy@mm.st and let's see
  if we can figure something out.
* Code needs to work on both Mac and Windows.
* The project is run on ["open open source"](http://openopensource.org)
  principles.
